    "\n",

    "Answer = Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two fundamental concepts in probability theory that describe the likelihood of different outcomes for random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability mass function (PMF) is a function that assigns probabilities to a discrete random variable. In other words, a PMF tells us the probability of each possible value of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the random variable representing the number of heads obtained when flipping a coin twice. The possible values of this random variable are 0, 1, or 2. The PMF for this random variable is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 0) = 1/4\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/2\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/4\n",
    "This PMF tells us that the probability of getting 0 heads is 1/4, the probability of getting 1 head is 1/2, and the probability of getting 2 heads is 1/4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to discrete values, a PDF assigns probabilities to intervals of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the random variable representing the height of a randomly selected adult. The possible values of this random variable are all real numbers between 4 feet and 7 feet. The PDF for this random variable cannot be represented as a simple list of probabilities because there are an infinite number of possible values. Instead, the PDF is represented by a function that gives the probability for any given interval of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the probability of the height being between 5.5 feet and 6 feet can be calculated by integrating the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the PMF and PDF is that the PMF applies to discrete random variables, while the PDF applies to continuous random variables. Additionally, the PMF assigns probabilities to individual values, while the PDF assigns probabilities to intervals of values.\n",

    "Comparing Distributions: The CDFs of different distributions can be compared to assess their relative dispersions. A steeper CDF indicates a more concentrated distribution, while a flatter CDF indicates a more spread-out distribution.\n",

    "Generating Random Samples: The CDF can be used to generate random samples from a distribution. This is often done using the inverse transform sampling method.\n",
